<h2>About</h2>
<hr>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
    This is an app where you can share your position to others on a map in a group.<br>
    A group can be joined or created with a 3 character long group code, where your<br>
    and other's positions will be shown by custom made markers.<br>
    <br><br>
    A group has a built-in chat with a camera feature. A group member can also start<br>
    a position goal for the group members by placing goal positions on the map.<br>
    <br><br>
    The map itself can be viewed with different layers and offers 8 different layer<br>
    types from Mapbox, including satellite imagery.<br>
