<h2>About</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    This is an app where you can share your position to others on a map in a group.
    A group can be joined or created with a 3 character long group code, where your
    and other's positions will be shown by custom made markers.
    <br>
    A group has a built-in chat with a camera feature. A group member can also start
    a position goal for the group members by placing goal positions on the map.
    <br>
    The map itself can be viewed with different layers and offers 8 different layer
    types from Mapbox, including satellite imagery.
